This guide explains how to run our transcriptome library analysis, transcriptome analysis combined with spatial tags, processing spatial locations, and handling spatial images pipeline for Stamp-seq sequencing data. We assume you have (1) obtained your spatial barcode library sequencing data in FASTQ format, and (2) also obtained your corresponding expression barcode library sequencing data in FASTQ format. 
A comprehensive overview of the data processing procedures, along with usage instructions, can be accessed at the following link: http://seekspace.seekgene.com/en/v1.0.0/2.tutorial/2.run.html.
